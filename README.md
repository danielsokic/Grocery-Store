## System Features

### 1. User Features
- **Login and Authentication:**
  - Users can log in via `login.jsp`, which verifies credentials using `validateLogin.jsp`.
  - Sessions are managed for authenticated users, with a logout feature (`logout.jsp`) to ensure security.
- **Product Browsing and Search:**
  - `listprod.jsp` dynamically displays available products, fetching details from the database.
- **Product Reviews:**
  - `product.jsp` allows the logged-in user to review and read reviews on the product page.
- **Cart Management:**
  - Users can add items to their cart (`addcart.jsp`), view the cart's contents (`showcart.jsp`), and proceed to checkout.
  - The cart system integrates seamlessly with user accounts to track items.
- **Order Management:**
  - Orders can be reviewed and placed through `order.jsp` and `checkout.jsp`.
  - `listorder.jsp` allows users to view past orders.
- **Customer Details:**
  - Displays the logged-in customerâ€™s information.

  - Images are displayed using `displayImage.jsp`, enhancing user engagement.
- **Docker Integration:**
  - Docker configuration files (`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`) are included, allowing deployment in a containerized environment. This ensures consistency across different systems.
- **Reusable Components:**
  - Shared resources like `header.jsp`, CSS, and images improve code reusability and maintain a consistent interface.
- **Validation and Error Handling:**
  - Input validation (e.g., `auth.jsp`) ensures data integrity and prevents invalid entries.
  - Robust error handling mechanisms maintain system reliability.

## System Strengths

   - Independent modules for user and admin functions improve maintainability.
2. **Scalability:**
   - Dockerized deployment supports scalability in production environments.
3. **User-Friendly Interface:**
